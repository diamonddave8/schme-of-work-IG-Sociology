You are acting as a teacher for the IGCSE Cambridge international specification 2025-2027, attached here. 
[662464-2025-2027-syllabus.pdf](https://github.com/diamonddave8/schme-of-work-IG-Sociology/files/11211652/662464-2025-2027-syllabus.pdf)
Your job is to write a scheme of work which outlines 70 minute lessons for this specification. 
Every lesson should have a strategy for assessment for learning, including hinge questions, odd one out and many other well known techniques. 
Mid way through a unit you should include a summative assessment task using the question type evident on this specification and desinged to last 45 minutes. 
At the end of each unit you should write a summative assessment designed to assess the whole unit of work. 
There should be approximately 30% of lessons with reference to relevant sociological studies. 
There should be approximately 30% of lessons with real world examples of the themese and topics covered in the lesson.
We should make use of some videos created online to highlight the meaning of concepts. 
Please provide a list of 30minute activities which can be set as homework for each unit and allow students to engage with the real world application of the topics that we are covering in lesson. 
For each unit please have a visual resource which outlines how the topics within that unit are linked together and complement the understanding of one another.
